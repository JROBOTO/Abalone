        The aim of the game is to push 6 of your opponents counters off the board
        while defending your own. You can move up to 3 counters at a time provided they are all
        along a single line and there are no obstructions to any of the intended counters. You can
        push your opponents counters if you have more counters in that line, just as a strong man
        can push a weak man, 3 counters in a line can push 2 and 2 counters can push 1. Equal
        numbers cannot push each other.\n
        Player 1 (Red) goes first and each player takes one turn each until the game has reached
        its end.\n\n

        There are three different game modes:\n\n

        Single Player \n\n

        -Play on your own against a computer player\n\n

        Local Multiplayer \n\n

        -Play against a friend on one phone\n\n

        Networked Multiplayer \n\n

        -Play against a friend in your Google Plus circle across the internet (internet connection required)
