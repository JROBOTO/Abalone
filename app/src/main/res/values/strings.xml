        The aim of the game is to push 6 of your opponents counters off the board
        while defending your own. You can move up to 3 counters at a time provided they are all
        along a single line and there are no obstructions to any of the intended counters. You can
        push your opponents counters if you have more counters in that line, just as a strong man
        can push a weak man, 3 counters in a line can push 2 and 2 counters can push 1. Equal
        numbers cannot push each other.
